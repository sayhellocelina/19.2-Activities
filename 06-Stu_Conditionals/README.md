# Conditionals Challenge

The goal of this activity is to familiarize yourself with conditionals and the logical and comparative operators they use.

## Instructions

- Open `conditional.html` in a browser and text editor. Open the console in the browser.

- Work through each conditional one by one only changing the value of the variables in order to log "Correct" in the console.

## Hints

- Each time you make a change, save the HTML file and refresh your browser. Don't try to tackle all six challenges and attempt to troubleshoot after.

- Pay attention to which variables are strings versus numbers. Some of the exercises require that you use a different type.

- Use [W3Schools - JavaScript Comparisons](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_comparisons.asp) as a reference to help you break down the code.
